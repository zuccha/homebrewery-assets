## Premise

The players have been tasked with retrieving _star musk_ from the inner chambers of the Sunbathed Cave and bringing back as much as they can.

Details such as the cave’s location, the purpose of the musk, and the urgency of the quest are left to the GMs running this mini-adventure.

{{note
##### Example: A Cursed Sleep

Some inhabitants of a forest village have fallen into a deep slumber, a cursed sleep from which they can’t be awakened without magical aid. The village elder tasks the adventurers with retrieving _star musk_, the key ingredient of the antidote, from the abandoned Sunbathed Cave, once a harvesting site for the musk, now reclaimed by the wilderness. The amount of musk the party recovers determines how many potions the local alchemist can brew and, therefore, how many villagers can be freed from the curse.
}}

## Star Musk

_Star musk_ is a deep, dark green plant that turns golden yellow and begins to glimmer after a few minutes of sunlight. This exposure not only changes the plant’s color but also activates its medicinal properties. For this transformation to occur, the musk must be exposed to sunlight **before it is harvested**; sunlight applied afterward has no effect.

The specific value and any additional properties of the musk are left to the GM, who may expand its uses or effects to suit their campaign.


## The Cave

The Sunbathed Cave owes its name to its south-facing entrance, which is exposed to the sun’s warmth for most of the day. Sunlight reflects off the crystalline walls, filling the corridors with a dim, warm glow.

The cave is also an ideal environment for _star musk_. The humidity and darkness of the deeper chambers allow the plant to thrive, covering the rocky walls.

Years ago, the locals used the cave as a harvesting site, taking advantage of its natural sunlight to awaken the musk’s medicinal properties. To bathe the plants in sunlight before harvesting, they carved windows into the rock and installed reflecting mirrors.

More recently, the cave has become a dangerous place. A colony of rust monsters spread through the tunnels, a group of myconids turned a few chambers into their home, and a pair of ogres claimed the deepest room. These inhabitants form an unlikely symbiosis.

### Two Ogres

Berto and Cambero are an ogre and an ogrillon, respectively. They killed or drove off the workers who once occupied the cave and settled in the deepest chamber. They dislike bright light and have sealed the windows and removed several of the mirrors that once reflected sunlight through the halls.

The two mostly feed on rust monsters that the myconids hunt for them, in exchange, the ogres fend off adventurers and ensure the cave remains dark.

### The Myconids

A small group of myconids, four adults and their leader, has taken up residence in the cave. They occupy the southwest chamber, where the sovereign’s iron-rich spores have allowed them to domesticate several of the rust monsters. The myconids raise the insects like cattle, butchering them and offering the remains as tribute to the ogres.

The myconids don't like any sort of light and see the ogres as the guardians of the cave.

### Rust Monsters

A colony of rust monsters thrives deep underground. When their tunnels broke into the Sunbathed Cave, the insects encountered the myconids. Several became conditioned by the sovereign’s spores and now behave like semi-tamed livestock, responding readily to its commands.

## Running the Adventure

This is a short, location-based adventure with a light puzzle element and several optional combats. The cave’s factions react logically to light, noise, and intrusion, but do not coordinate. Characters can approach the rooms in any order, with sunlight-activation as the only required mechanic. Most encounters can be bypassed with smart play or negotiation.

## Exploring the Cave

The adventurers must explore the cave to retrieve as much _star musk_ as possible. The plant grows in the three main chambers of the cave (areas 6, 7, and 8), each equipped with a different method for exposing the musk to sunlight before it’s harvested:

* **Northeast room (6):** Requires four mirrors to reflect sunlight from the cave's entrance to the chamber; three are missing and scattered in areas 3, 6, and 7.
* **North room (7):** Requires magical sunlight; _Sunlight_ scrolls are available in areas 3 and 5.
* **Southwest room (8):** Requires clearing rubble and opening shutters on the south wall.

Characters can use any of the methods mentioned above to expose the musk to sunlight, or they may devise their own solutions. However, the plant must receive at least three minutes of direct sunlight; ordinary light sources (such as torches or the _Daylight_ spell) aren’t sufficient.

**Light in the Cave.** Unless noted otherwise, most of the cave is in dim light. The myconids are wary of any bright light and become hostile when exposed to it, while the cave’s other inhabitants simply react with irritation.

**Resting.** The cave is dangerous but not patrolled. A short rest is generally safe in cleared rooms; a long rest may attract wandering rust monsters at the GM’s discretion.

\column

### 1: Entrance

{{descriptive
A wide opening in the mountainside stands 5 meters across and 6 meters tall. Sunlight floods the entrance, its reflections on the crystalline walls casting a dim, warm glow into the three tunnels that branch away into darkness. The grassy ground outside quickly gives way to rough stone as the path descends into the mountain’s depths. A broken cart lies near the entrance, overgrown with vines, a silent reminder of the cave’s long-abandoned harvest operations.
}}

Footprints of varying age mark the ground near the entrance, showing regular movement to and from the cave. The ogres leave the cave at night to hunt, while the myconids never venture outside. The only traces of their passage date back to when they first migrated into the cave. A character can make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) check to determine their number and nature.

##### Footprint Information
| Result | Footprints                             |
|:-------|:---------------------------------------|
| 9-     | No useful information.                 |
| 10-14  | Various recent footprints are visible. |
| 15-19  | Some of the tracks belong to an ogre.  |
| 20-24  | There are two sets of ogre tracks.     |
| 25+    | Older myconid tracks are also present. |

### 2: Cul-de-Sac

{{descriptive
A large, straight tunnel, 5 meters tall, leads deeper within the cave. The dim light from the entrance fades as the passage descends. Close by lies a dead end, marked only by a sharp, acrid smell.
}}

This tunnel is the route the ogres prefer, comfortably accommodating their size. Berto often stops to urinate here. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check identifies the smell as ogre urine.

A cloth-covered mirror hangs on the wall of the cul-de-sac, 3 meters above the ground. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check notices it. A similar, though mirrorless, wooden bracket on the wall facing the corridor back to the entrance can be spotted after a quick follow-up investigation.

### 3: Spider-Infested Tunnel

{{descriptive
Thick, dense layers of spiderweb fill this narrow passage. Venturing into the tangled mass is an undertaking best left to the brave and capable.
}}

The tunnel is only 1.5 meters wide and 2.5 meters tall. Two giant wolf spiders have turned the passage into their nest, weaving webs to ensnare unlucky travelers.

**Treasure.** Within the tunnel lies the body of a dead adventurer. The corpse carries 3 gp and a _spell scroll_ containing the _Sunlight_ spell. In a recess 4.5 meters from the north opening lies a _mirror_ worth 5 gp.

**Spotting.** A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check notices one of the spiders. On a 15 or higher, they spot both spiders and the dead adventurer caught in the webs. On an 18 or higher, they also notice the spell scroll clutched in the adventurer’s hand.

**Traversing the Web.** Moving through the webs requires a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check each turn. On a failure, the character becomes Restrained and must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw at the end of their turn to break free.

**Fighting the Spiders.** Any intrusion into the tunnel or damage dealt to the webs causes the spiders to attack. A character attempting to sneak through the passage must make a single Dexterity (Stealth) check opposed by the spiders’ passive Wisdom (Perception). A failure alerts the spiders immediately.

**Burning the Web.** The webs are highly flammable. If ignited, flames spread through the entire passage and burn for 1 minute. Any creature caught in the fire is subject to the Burning hazard, and the spiders immediately flee using all their movement. When the flames die out, the webs are destroyed, and the adventurer’s spell scroll is reduced to ash.

### 4: Crossways

{{descriptive
A large, open chamber stretches before you. A rocky pillar rises to the ceiling, where it meets a cluster of stalactites that hang menacingly overhead. Puddles of water dot the floor, formed by droplets that constantly fall from the mineral formations. The room contains a few empty wooden crates and a small table built into the wall. In the past, this chamber likely served as a place for collecting and sorting the musk.
}}

The crates contain nothing of value, having long since rotted away. On the table lies a pile of ruined documents, most of them unreadable, but one surviving note describes the instructions for exposing the musk to sunlight, as follows:

{{descriptive
##### Instructions for Harvesting the Star Musk
To activate its medicinal properties, star musk must be exposed to sunlight for a few minutes before it is harvested. Each chamber where the plant grows in large amounts uses a different method to provide that sunlight:
* Northeast room: A system of four mirrors reflects sunlight from the entrance into the chamber. The mirrors must be correctly aligned.
* North room: This chamber is too deep within the cave for natural or mechanical illumination, so magical light is required. Spell scrolls containing a sunlight-producing spell are stored in the storage closet in the northwest corridor.
* Southwest room: Windows carved into the southern wall allow direct sunlight inside. Remember to close the shutters afterward, because too much light prevents the musk from growing.
}}

If the characters inspect the desk area, a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the storage closet key hidden under the table. The key has a label attached.

### 5: Storage Closet Corridor

The corridor is initially blocked by a pile of fallen rocks, which can be noticed with a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Clearing the obstruction takes about 5 minutes and reveals the passage to the storage closet.

The closet door is secured with a rusty lock, which can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves’ tools, or broken with an attack.

**Treasure.** The closet contains three _torches_ and one _spell scroll_ containing the _Sunlight_ spell. Two additional scrolls are present but too damaged to use. However, if _Mending_ is cast on them, the scrolls are restored to their original form. They are blank and can be used to scribe a cantrip or 1st-level spell, covering the usual scribing cost of 25 gp each.

### 6: Pantry

{{descriptive
An open chamber with a high ceiling, its walls covered in thick growths of star musk. Four myconids work methodically, shelling and dismembering dead rust monsters and tossing the remains onto an already substantial pile, creating what can only be described as a grotesque pantry.
}}

This chamber is where the myconids prepare their offerings for the ogres. Four **myconid adults** are focused on their work and pay little attention to the entrance. The characters can choose to ambush them or attempt to establish communication.

At first, the myconids are wary and hostile toward humanoid intruders. If the characters enter the chamber carrying lit torches or any other source of illumination, the myconids attack immediately. Otherwise, the characters can attempt to communicate with them, though the myconids refuse to tolerate any form of light. Exposure to torchlight or similar brightness makes them aggressive, while direct sunlight causes them to panic and flee, as it is lethal to them. If spoken to, the myconids can reveal information about the cave and their relation with the ogres.

**Star Musk.** The walls of the chamber are covered with _star musk_. If the characters successfully place all the mirrors on their wooden brackets throughout the cave, sunlight reaches this chamber. As the light fills the space, patches of musk begin to glow and shift to a bright golden yellow. The characters can harvest 0.5 kilograms of musk after 3-5 minutes of exposure.

**Treasure.** A _mirror_ worth 5 gp lies partially buried beneath the pile of rust monster carcasses. Any character who inspects the pile finds it automatically. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check can spot a glint of glass beneath the remains without approaching. Additionally, a character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check discovers several medicinal plants growing among the musk. These plants can be used as ingredients for brewing a _potion of healing_.

### 7: Ogres' Lair

{{descriptive
A large passage descends into the earth along a steep path of uneven rocky steps. The dim light around the party fades, and only darkness awaits ahead.
}}

The north chamber is not visible from the crossways. The characters must first descend a steep tunnel to reach the ogres’ lair. If the characters enter the chamber, they must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check or the sleeping ogres wake up.

**Alert.** The DC increases by 5 for each of the following or similar actions the characters may have performed earlier in the cave: breaking the lock on the storage closet, fighting the myconids in the pantry, burning the spiderwebs, or entering the room with a bright light source.

{{descriptive
A vast, mostly round chamber opens before you. The walls are covered with star musk, and a clear pool of water rests along the right side. At the far end lies a mound of collected treasures. Two ogres sleep on makeshift beds.
}}

The ogres are hostile toward intruders, but can be bribed to let the characters pass, share information, or remain neutral if offered enough meat. Convincing them requires a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check, reduced by 1 for each dead Medium-sized creature the characters offer as food. A successful check makes them indifferent and willing to trade the mirror for the meat. The ogres still refuse bright light and turn hostile if threatened or illuminated.

**Fighting the Ogres.** Berto is an **ogre**, and Cambero is an **ogrillon ogre**. They are hungry and focus on the most appealing target. Once per fight, Berto can use his Reaction to slam his club against the floor, causing stalactites to fall in the center of the chamber. All creatures within a 3-meter radius must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage and 1d6 bludgeoning damage, taking half on a success.

A character can also try to collapse the stalactites by spending an Action and succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check, provided they notice the hazard.

**Star Musk.** The walls of the chamber are covered with _star musk_. If the characters manage to illuminate the chamber with sunlight, patches of star musk begin to glow and turn a bright golden yellow. The characters can harvest 1 kilogram of musk after 3-5 minutes of exposure.

**Treasure.** The ogres have amassed a small pile of treasures in the room. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check (requiring sight) reveals a _mirror_ worth 5 gp among the treasure. On a result of 20 or higher, the character also spots two _silver ingots_ worth 25 gp each. The characters automatically find all the treasure if they take time to thoroughly search the room.

### 8: Myconid's Nest

The pathway to the southwest room is blocked by a dense wall of fungal filaments. The barrier opens automatically in response to myconid spores, but it can also be affected by environmental forces. Pouring at least a waterskin of water onto the filaments softens them, causing the wall to retract. The fungal mass has 15 hit points, AC 10, and is vulnerable to fire and radiant damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points destroys the barrier and clears the way into the nest. A persuaded or cooperative myconid can also open the gate safely for the characters.

{{descriptive
A moldy smell hangs in the air, and a soft veil of spores drifts through the chamber. Two corpses of fallen adventurers lie scattered across the floor, surrounding a towering fungal figure whose hyphae extend from the center of the room to the surrounding walls.
}}

{{pageNumber,auto}}


\page


This is where the myconids reside when they are not preparing offerings in the pantry. The myconid sovereign never leaves this chamber, and its filaments extend deep into the ground and through the cave, keeping it confined to this room. Through the hyphae, the sovereign senses disturbances such as movement, bright light, or violence elsewhere in the cave, but it cannot perceive details or communicate at a distance.

**The Room.** The west wall features several openings that connect to the rust monsters’ colony. From here, the sovereign releases calming spores that lure rust monsters to be killed and butchered for the ogres. The south wall contains several windows that open to the outside. These windows are sealed on the inside by fungal filaments, and the wooden shutters can be forced open with a DC 15 Strength check. From the outside, the windows are buried under rubble; a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the blocked openings, and clearing the rubble takes a few minutes of work. Opening the shutters exposes the chamber to sunlight, which burns the myconid sovereign, and its filaments prevent it from leaving the room.

**Reactions and Interactions.** If the characters begin applying force to the shutters from the outside, the sovereign sends a telepathic plea urging them to leave. The characters experience the mental message, but they do not know its source unless they have already met the sovereign or observed its behavior in another room. When the characters enter the room, the sovereign communicates with them. Its attitude is hostile if the characters tore down the fungal barrier, killed the other myconids, slew the ogres, or opened the windows, and neutral otherwise. The sovereign warns the characters to leave the cave in peace.

**Fighting the sovereign.** If the characters ignore the warning, the **myconid sovereign** summons two **rust monsters** from the nearby tunnels and awakens a **myconid spore servant** lying on its side, then attacks the party. Once per combat, the myconid sovereign can use its action to regrow a weakened version of the fungal barrier in the doorway. The wall is solid and forms with 5 hit points and AC 10.

**Star Musk.** The walls of the chamber are covered with _star musk_. If the characters open the shutters, sunlight fills the space and patches of musk begin to glow and shift to a bright golden yellow. The characters can harvest 0.5 kilograms of musk after 3-5 minutes of exposure.

**Treasure.** A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check discovers several medicinal plants growing among the musk. These plants can be used as ingredients for brewing a _potion of healing_. In addition, the characters can collect a small amount of _myconid rapport spores_. When a character touches the spores, they feel a brief tingling at the edge of their thoughts. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check identifies the residue as preserved rapport spores, enough to allow two creatures to briefly communicate telepathically. The spores are stored in a small vessel of natural crystal worth 10 gp.

## Ending the Adventure

Once the characters have harvested the _star musk_ from the illuminated chambers, they can leave the Sunbathed Cave at any time. The cave’s inhabitants do not pursue them outside.

Returning the musk to the quest-giver completes the adventure. The amount of musk gathered determines how many doses of medicine can be produced or how many people can be helped, depending on the quest’s premise.

### Aftermath

Depending on the characters’ actions, the cave’s balance may shift:
- If the ogres survive: They may seek tribute from nearby settlements or try to reclaim the cave after the musk is harvested.
- If the myconids survive: They slowly reseal the tunnels and restore darkness. They may become strange, reclusive allies or future obstacles.
- If both factions are disrupted: Rust monsters spread unchecked through the tunnels, creating a new problem for locals.
- If sunlight is restored to the cave: Some chambers slowly return to their former use, and locals may resume harvesting operations.

You can extend the adventure by introducing a new threat attracted to the sunlight or by revealing that the musk’s effects are only the first step in a larger mystery.

### Rewards

In addition to any treasure found in the cave, the characters may receive further compensation depending on the quest-giver’s needs or the campaign’s tone.
